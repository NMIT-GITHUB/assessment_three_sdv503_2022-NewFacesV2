# Hi Ali

All of the .cs files are inside of the SDV A3 FINAL folder.

I'm not sure how this happened but I could not figure out how to fix it.

Visual studio gave me alot of trouble, I hope the repository works fine for you. I tested all of the code in a seperate project because
I had issues getting it to work in this repository, all the code was working succesfully, It just had not been tested inside this repository.

Sorry if this causes you any trouble!
